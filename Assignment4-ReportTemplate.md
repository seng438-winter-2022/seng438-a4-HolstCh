# Introduction
In this assignment, we were tasked with engaging with two different kinds of testing: Mutation Testing and Graphical User interface (GUI) testing. Mutation testing, also known as Fault-based testing, involves the injection of artificial faults into the System Under Test (SUT). Syntactic (syntax-based) variations are applied in a systematic way to the SUT to create faulty versions of the program which exhibit different behaviors in comparison to the program's actual functionality. Mutant testing then seeks to help create a test suite that will be able to catch these faults.  In the first part of the lab. We injected mutation faults into a Java code-base using a mutation testing tool, the PIT Mutation test tool. Interpreted the mutation coverage data and developed new test cases to increase the mutation coverage of our test suites for the DataUtilities class and Range class. In the second part of the lab, we engaged in GUI test automation, recording and playing, which involved testing a product that implemented a graphical user interface using testing software tools, Selenium and SikuliX. We focused on semi-automated test generation using the capturing and replaying of user actions on the GUI using the testing tools.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
Original Values of Mutation coverage for DataUtilities class and the Range class before test suite modification:


# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed


# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
